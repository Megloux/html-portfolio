<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've been a nationally ranked competitive dancer, math teacher, entrepreneur and a fitness instructor.</p>

<p>I'm a slow thinker (because I believ your first reaction is usually outdated), a risk taker, explorer, love a different point of view and hyperbole.</p>

<p>New Mexico native, I now live in Charlotte North Carolina.</p>
