<h3>You Can Negotaite Aything by Herb Cohen</h3>
<p>Everything is negotiable. Challenge authority.  You have the power in any situation. A must read classic from 1980 from a master negotaitor.  This little book is filled with so may memoriable stories - examples of great day to day moments of negotiation that will stick in your head for when you need them.</p>
<br />
<h3>The Listening Book by W.A. Mathieu</h3>
<p>Everyone should read this book of essays about listening.  It teaches your ears to pay more attention.  It calls your attention to sounds you hadn't noticed.  It's beautifully written and makes your life better</p>

<h3>The Courage To Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga</h3>
<p>Wow. A profound little philosopy book from Japan, communicating the psychology of Alfred Adler - a rival of Freud. Told as a conversation between an angry student and a patient teacher.  A suprisingly fresh perspective on how to live.</p>
