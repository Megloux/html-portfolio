<h3>The Couerage To Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga</h3>
<p>Wow. A profound little philosopy book from Japan, communicating the psychology of Alfred Adler - a rival of Freud. Told as a conversation between an angry student and a patient teacher.  A suprisingly fresh perspective on how to live.</p>
